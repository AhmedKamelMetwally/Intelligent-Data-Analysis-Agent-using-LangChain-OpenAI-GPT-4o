🚀 Project Update: Intelligent Data Analysis Agent using LangChain & OpenAI GPT-4o 🔍📊
I'm excited to share a recent project I built using Python, LangChain, and OpenAI GPT-4o — a natural language data analysis agent that simplifies and automates the way we interact with SQL databases.
🛠️ What it does:
•	Accepts any SQL database URL and connects seamlessly.
•	Users can ask questions in natural language (e.g., "What was the highest sale last month?").
•	The agent automatically converts the question into an accurate SQL query.
•	Executes the query and returns the response in human-readable language.
🧪 Tested using a public MySQL database:
mysql://rfamro@mysql-rfam-public.ebi.ac.uk:4497/Rfam
This open-access Rfam database served as a great testbed for running real-time SQL queries via natural language prompts.
💡 Why this matters:
This tool empowers non-technical users and data analysts to perform complex data analysis without writing a single line of SQL. It streamlines database exploration and enhances decision-making by making data more accessible.
📈 A step toward AI-powered analytics automation — bridging the gap between natural language understanding and structured data queries.
